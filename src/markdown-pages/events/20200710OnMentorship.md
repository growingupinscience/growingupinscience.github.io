Panelists: Akiko Iwasaki (immunobiology, Yale), Wei Ji Ma (cognitive science, NYU), Yael Niv (cognitive neuroscience, Princeton), and Jay Van Bavel (social psychology, NYU)

The first part in a themed series on mentorship. We discussed:

Have you experienced or directly heard about any examples of toxic mentorship near you?
What structural changes do you think are needed to improve mentorship in academia?
