The road to earning a PhD is often long, winding, and bumpy. It can be difficult to prepare for this academic journey. The advice and guidance of fellow PhD students can serve as a powerful tool to help new students and those applying for PhD programs have an idea of what to expect and how to navigate the grad school environment. In this panel session, we aimed to provide aspiring and new PhD students with a glimpse of the graduate student experience by learning what current PhD students from various disciplines and backgrounds wished they had known before starting their graduate studies.
