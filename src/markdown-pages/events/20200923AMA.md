This event was part of the Growing up in Science series on academic mentorship. Part 1 was a Q&A panel to answer questions of mentees and mentors about the mentoring relationship and how to deal with problems that come up. Panel: Chiara Bertipaglia (Columbia University), Adrienne Fairhall (University of Washington), Keith Doelling (Institut Pasteur), and Yael Niv (Princeton University). Part 2 was a presentation by Amir Tal (Columbia University) on the platform LabGuru, with time for feedback. Insights on selecting a lab can still be submitted via this [5-10 minute survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSekfkhDQRzLioaPI53kvv9XmTLuWcsCSkyz2d-Cr9Sq7DUxzg/viewform)
