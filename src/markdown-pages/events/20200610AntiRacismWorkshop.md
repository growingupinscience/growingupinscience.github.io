Growing up in [Science and the Scientist Action and Advocacy Network](https://scaan.net/) jointly participated in the [#ShutDownSTEM](https://www.shutdownstem.com/) day of action through a workshop on allyship and anti-racism in science. This event is was the first in the Growing up in Science anti-racism series. We asked our audience for their comments in the following categories:
- (micro-)aggressions experienced
- (micro-)aggressions committed (by you or others)
- aspects of systemic racism that you find most urgent/actionable
- concrete steps you plan to take to be an ally and practice anti-racism

Moderators were Mina Cikara, Nancy Padilla, Yael Niv, and Wei Ji Ma. Documentation of the event:
