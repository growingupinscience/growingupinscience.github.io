<p>Maureen Craig earned her undergraduate degree in Psychology (with minors in Sociology and Women's Studies) at Purdue University and received her PhD in Social Psychology from Northwestern University. She spent two years as a post-doctoral fellow in the Psychology Department at Ohio State University before joining the New York University Psychology Department as an assistant professor in 2016. Her work focuses on understanding social and political attitudes among members of different social groups (e.g., groups based on race, gender, sexuality), both among individuals belonging to traditionally-stigmatized groups and those belonging to societally-dominant groups (as well as individuals with both types of group identities). Her primary research interests are in how diversity, inequality, and discrimination shape individuals' attitudes and relations with people from other social groups, basic social cognitive processes, policy preferences, and support for collective action.</p>
