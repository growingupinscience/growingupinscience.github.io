He spent ten years in the Neurobiology Lab at Cornell Medical school, and in 1989 joined the new Center for Neural Science at NYU as the first outside hire. Currently, he is a University Professor and Henry and Lucy Moses Professor of Science at NYU in the Center for Neural Science and Psychology. He is also a Professor of Psychiatry and Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at NYU Langone Medical School. His work is focused on the brain mechanisms of emotion, memory, and consciousness. LeDoux has received international awards for his research and is also an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He is the author of several books, including The Emotional Brain, Synaptic Self, Anxious, The Deep History of Ourselves, and The Four Realms of Existence, and co-author of The Integrated Mind (1978) and is a co-author of Against Happiness (2023). LeDoux did his PhD studying consciousness in split-brain patients. Although was particularly interested in emotional consciousness in humans, the tools available for studying the human brain were quite limited in the late 70s and early 80s. As a result, chose to study how the brain controls emotional behaviors in rodents using Pavlovian fear conditioning as a tool for tracing neural circuits. Although he had a large role in shaping the “amygdala fear center” idea, late in his career he rejected this notion and offered an alternative view in which defensive behaviors occur in parallel to cognitively constructed conscious feelings of fear. He closed his lab at NYU in August 2023 and will officially retire in August 2025.\n\n### Unofficial Story\nMy father, Boo LeDoux, rode bulls as teenager during the Great Depression, and then, after a back-damaging fall from one of the beasts, he returned to Eunice, a small town in the region of southwest Louisiana known as Cajun Country, and took over has father’s meat market. Much of his life was shaped by his notion of himself as a cowboy, which he truly was. At the age of 60, he took up bull riding again for several years, stopping only because my mother, Pris, the face of the business and the accountant, threatened to divorce him. To the extent that I had a job in the market it was to peel away the tough, inedible sheet of tissue covering the brain and remove the lead bullet with my tiny fingers—customers did not fancy chomping down on lead when they ate sautéed brains. It was intensely satisfying to pull the two halves of the brain apart, exposing a tennis-racket-looking structure and its wrinkly decoration. Later in life, I learned the tough tissue is the dura mater, the bullet was lodged in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the tennis racket is the brainstem, and its wrinkly decoration is the cerebellum. That had no impact on my career choice, but it certainly gave me a leg up when I became a neuroscientist. I never aspired to be a scientist. And no one who knew me in Eunice would’ve guessed that I'd end up in that line of work. I was a decent student, but not a great one, and science was neither one of my better nor favorite subjects.  The main thing I cared about was music. There was Cajun and country music galore in Eunice. But as long as I can remember, I loved pop music. In high school I was in rock ‘n’ roll bands, was a DJ, and dreamed of being a musician. In college, other than a “physics for dummies’” kind of class—an elective for non-majors— I took no other science courses. That was easy, since I majored in business administration, and then proceeded to get a master’s degree in marketing. Yet, less than four years later, I had a PhD for discoveries I made about human consciousness in the brains of neurological patients. After that, I spent the rest of my career working on the brain mechanisms of emotion and memory in rodents to better understand human emotional behavior. In my late 50s, my success as a neuroscientist made it possible for me to actually become a musician and even a song writer. That may seem like an odd consequence of being a neuroscientist, but that’s what happened. In 2006, I formed a band with Tyler Volk (Professor of Biology) on lead guitar, Daniela Schiller (post-doc) on drums, and Nina Curly (Daniela’s research assistant) on bass. I played rhythm guitar and wrote songs about mind and brain, a genre that came to be called “heavy mental”. We mostly played for lab parties. But one thing led to another, and we started playing in clubs in NYC and decided to record our music. The title of the first album was, of course, Heavy Mental. The Amygdaloids really caught on. In the early days, we were written about widely in the popular press the New York Times, Salon, and the Huffington Post and PNAS even had a news story titled The Amygdaloids. Our music videos have been viewed many times (one about ninety thousand times) on The Amygdaloids YouTube channel. Often when I am asked to give a lecture, the hosts request the band. I offer instead Colin Dempsey, the band’s current bass player, and my partner in the acoustic duo, So We Are. We have played acoustic versions of The Amygdaloids heavy mental catalog in Rome, Mexico City, Stockholm, and many other places. Our next gig is in Rio in June 2024. The band’s second album, Theory of My Mind, was produced in 2010 by an organization called Knockout Noise. In 2017, they decided to follow up with a documentary about my early life in South Louisiana Cajun country, my research, and my musical career. Featured were neuroscientists (Mike Gazzaniga, Eric Kandel, Daniela Schiller, Liz Phelps) and musicians (Rosanne Cash, Lenny Kaye). It can be seen on Amazon. During that same time, Lynne Kaufman, a San Francisco playwright, wrote to me saying she was working on a musical about a PTSD therapy group session and came across my research on traumatic memory reconsolidation and my music. She thought that my song Map of Your Mind might be a good fit and asked if she could use it. I told her she could use as many of my songs as she liked. As a result, lyrical content of fifteen of my songs were used to create the narrative arc of the musical. We did a staged reading in San Francisco and are currently working on a performance in New York.\n","frontmatter":{"slug":"/stories/josephledoux","date":"2024-03-27","title":"Joseph LeDoux","tags":["story","event","global"],"zoom":"https://nyu.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJErcuyrrjMtHNQMbJ9MRBzs5_Ul_w0uby0Z#/registration"}},{"id":"GabrielleGutierrez","slug":"/stories/gabriellegutierrez","content":"### Official Story\nDr. Gabrielle Gutierrez is a computational and theoretical neuroscientist who has worked on a range of scientific questions.

She didn’t really stop to think about a career in STEM even though she was often the top student in her math and science classes, and she really enjoyed those subjects. Even college didn’t seem like an inevitability. Thankfully, with the guidance of some great mentors, Gabrielle found her way to majoring in physics in college. One fateful afternoon, she saw a public lecture that introduced her to the budding field of computational and theoretical neuroscience. She went to grad school for neuroscience, learned how to be an electrophysiologist, and later came back around to the thing that drew her in initially - computational neuroscience. By then, her quantitative skills had atrophied somewhat and she wasn’t sure what kind of a researcher she was or whether she was even cut out for theory. After exploring lots of different things during multiple postdocs, she finally embraced her theorist identity and found her true calling as an assistant professor at an undergraduate institution.\n","frontmatter":{"slug":"/stories/gabriellegutierrez","date":"2023-12-18","title":"Gabrielle Gutierrez","tags":["story","event","global"]}},{"id":"SusanCarey","slug":"/stories/susancarey","content":"### Official Story\nSusan Carey entered at Radcliffe College with an interest in math/science, settled on cognitive science in her junior year, graduated summa cum laude in 1964, having worked with Peter Wason, George Miller and Jerome Bruner in the earliest days of the Center for Cognitive Studies at Harvard. After a Fulbright in London, she returned to Harvard for a PhD, settling on cognitive development/language acquisition as a topic of study, working with Jerome Bruner and Roger Brown. After finishing her PhD in 1971, she was a lecturer at Harvard for 1 year, and then moved to MIT, where she taught for 24 years, then moved to NYU for 5 years, and then back to Harvard where she held a named chair for the last 23 years of her career and served as the first female chair of the Harvard Department of Psychology. Her career in developmental cognitive science was much lauded, recognized by the Nicod Prize (Paris), the Rumelhart Prize (Cognitive Science Society), the Eleanor Maccoby Award, (Cognitive Development Society), election as the fourth president of the Society for Philosophy and Psychology, an APA Distinctive Scientific Achievement Award, an APS William James Award, a Guggenheim Fellowship and the Atkinson Prize (National Academy of Sciences), and election to the NAS, the American Academy of Arts of Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and as a corresponding fellow to the British Academy.\n\n### Unofficial Story\nSusan Carey came to college from rural Illinois with no idea of what exactly she was really interested in, tried anthropology and biology and settled on cognitive studies in her junior year. After working as a research assistant for Peter Wason in the summer before her senior year, after which he returned to the University of London, she wrote an unmentored undergraduate thesis on the cost of negation in on-line processing, and also worked as a paid research assistant to Jerome Bruner on Piaget's conservation of matter phenomena during her senior year. Bruner subsequently plagiarized the paper she wrote for a graduate seminar he taught in the spring of her senior year, publishing it word for word with a footnote thanking Susan Carey \"for help in analyzing the data...\" This being 1964, Carey decided studying science was too far from the pressing political issues of the day (the Civil Rights Movement, the beginnings of the anti-Vietnam war movement). Women's Liberation and Gay Liberation (the terms of the day) were still years away. She went off to work with political refugees in East Africa where she met Malcolm X and then to London to study African history. She soon realized that African History involved a lot of time alone in dusty libraries. Fortunately, joining Peter Wason's lab meeting (she had never encountered the institution of \"lab meeting\" before) at University College London, she discovered that the issues in cognitive psychology still interested her, and she loved the collaborative nature of science. Now 25 years-old, she realized she actually had to find a job, and the only thing she knew how to do well was be a student, so she decided to apply to graduate school, where she could be supported for being a student. She wasn't really committing herself to being a scientist, which was not surprising, as she had never been taught by a woman or even heard a professional talk by a woman. Back at Harvard for a PhD, her attempts to find an advisor for work in cognitive psychology spectacularly failed (including the suicide of one short-lived advisor). She also had several experiences which gave her the message that that there was no role for women in academia. This led her back to politics, and she became active in the fledgling \"second wave of feminism\" the Women's Liberation Movement. The searing experience with her advisor's suicide led her to choose Bruner as an advisor, as he was sane, his work was very interesting, and he was a champion of women in academia, very unusual at the time, even as he stole from them (he plagiarized from her PhD dissertation also). Her unpublishable, unmentored, PhD dissertation was a piece of juvenalia, and the only time she even presented it in a conference, well-meaning, slightly older colleagues who were already established as leaders in cognitive psychology, took her to lunch and told her to abandon what she had settled on as her life work or she would surely fail in academia. She rejected this advice, but correctly concluded that she had humiliated herself in her first conference presentation. The next 4 or 5 conference submissions related to this work were rejected, and she got a similar message from the chair of the MIT department, when he offered her a job under the pressure of affirmative action but suggested she might prefer to be a research associate than an Assistant Professor. She said no, she preferred being an Assistant Professor. In the third prong (neuroscience, perception/computation, cognition) of MIT's forward looking \"psychology\" department--later renamed the Brain and Cognitive Science Department, she was constantly reminded that the third prong did not have tenure (in the words of the chair). Indeed, the brain scientists repeatedly tried to dissociate themselves from the work done in the cognitive wing of the department, including trying but failing to kick her wing out of the department. Carey's presentation will focus on coming into science during a sink-or-swim approach to graduate training, during the transition to women having a place at the table, and on dealing with failures and set-backs, (a thick skin is helpful) which continue to today, as well as the role of accident and luck in a career in science.\n\n","frontmatter":{"slug":"/stories/susancarey","date":"2023-11-14","title":"Susan Carey","tags":["story","event","harvard","nyu"],"video":"DEeH1u57GPI?si=4uIOEVkwOWMXg63s"}},{"id":"VishnuMurty","slug":"/stories/vishnumurty","content":"### Official Story\nVishnu “Deepu” Murty received his PhD in Neurobiology with a certificate in Cognitive Neuroscience from Duke University, followed by a post-doctoral fellowship at New York University in the Department of Psychology. His first faculty position was in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh, and he is currently an Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology and Neuroscience at Temple University. His laboratory, the Adaptive Memory Laboratory, characterizes how neuromodulatory systems influence memory and memory-guided decisions. He studies these interactions in a variety of domains including reward, threat, curiosity, and agency. His work has been supported by multiple funding agencies, including the National Institutes of Mental Health, the National Institutes on Drug Abuse, the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes on Aging, and the Brain Behavior Research Foundation. Outside of the laboratory, he is an advocate for queer representation in Psychology and Neuroscience as well as developing strategies for greater inclusion of under-represented populations in research.\n\n### Unofficial Story\nDeepu started college at Brown University motivated and starry-eyed about starting his path to becoming a doctor. In his Sophomore year, he failed Organic Chemistry 2, which was a prerequisite for applying to medical school. This failure set the first of many professional spirals. In response, he cycled through 4 different majors over the course of 2 years, which eventually landed him in Neuroscience. The summer before his senior year, he started doing research and finally, something felt right. While you would think that inspiration would be enough to pursue a career in basic science research, instead some need to be “a professional” drew him to clinical neuropsychology. After 6-months of working in this lab, he had yet another oh no movement and switched over to a related, cognitive neuroscience research laboratory. Following this new thread for basic science research, he started his PhD in Neurobiology at Duke University. Weirdly, he decided to do his PhD in Neurobiology, even though he knew his passion was psychology (a question that still has yet to be answered!). Suffering through coursework that he was not the most interested in, his PhD research gave him an immense sense of satisfaction. Despite this love for research, graduate school was punctuated with multiple episodes of depression adding more stress to an already stressful endeavor. After completing his PhD, he started a post-doctoral fellowship at NYU, where he dove deeper into memory research. While things in the laboratory were gangbusters, living alone in an isolating city triggered a few more episodes of depression. To combat loneliness, Deepu threw himself even further into his work. While this increased his research productivity, this took a toll on his personal life. After 3 years of post-doc, which included 2 years of failing on the Psychology job market (30+ applications, 5 interviews, 0 offers), he was feeling a sense of urgency to get out of New York City. He ended up confirming a position as a junior faculty member in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh. Although this was not aligned with his career goals, at least he was finally in the same city as his family. Being stuck doing research that was not his passion, he slowly started treating his job as a 9 to 5. While this was a huge professional setback, he learned it was nice to have a life outside of work. He developed hobbies, a non-work friendship group, and even time for romantic relationships. But now the pendulum swung in the other direction, where his personal life was the main drive and not his career. After 2 years in a position that was not a right fit, he went back on the Psychology job market and landed a position at Temple University. While at Temple—despite accruing 10+ failed grant submissions, another episode of depression requiring a 1-month leave of absence, and many late nights in the laboratory—balance seemed to be achieved. He currently runs an active research group, pursues hobbies and friendships, enjoys a mostly healthy romantic relationship, and tries to appreciate the path that brought him here. While balance has been mostly achieved, the good times are intermixed with a smidge of existential dread about being overwhelmed forever and not having panic attacks about the well-being of his trainees. However, a healthy mixture of therapy, supportive friends, SSRIs, and sage mentorship has provided support to get over these insecurities and remember to find the fun in his job.\n\n","frontmatter":{"slug":"/stories/vishnumurty","date":"2023-10-16","title":"Vishnu \"Deepu\" Murty","tags":["story","event","global"],"video":"KwSGIlRB4bo?si=ZFLm997fRun0qmLe"}},{"id":"KenwayLouie","slug":"/stories/kenwaylouie","content":"### Official Story\nKenway graduated with undergraduate degrees in chemical engineering and molecular biology from MIT. He entered the MD-PhD program at Harvard Medical School, completing his PhD in biology at MIT using multi-electrode recording techniques to study memory reactivation during sleep. After receiving his MD from Harvard, he completed postdoctoral work with Paul Glimcher at the Center for Neural Science at NYU, studying value coding in animal and human decision circuits. He became a Research Assistant Professor at CNS in 2012, where his work focuses on the neurophysiological, computational, and behavioral aspects of contextual value coding and decision making. He holds a joint appointment at the NYU Langone Neuroscience Institute, where he currently serves as the Computational Core Director for the BRAIN Initiative Oxytocin U19 and Study Director for the ASTOP clinical trial on neural activity changes after interventional treatment for PTSD.\n\n### Unofficial Story\nKenway was born in NYC, one of a pair of fraternal twins to parents who had fled China in the 1950s. He grew up as one of the few Asian students in Long Island suburbs, where he and his brother both excelled academically but struggled to socially adjust. This struggle was not entirely helped by skipping several grades along the way, motivated by tiger mom parenting (before the term was coined), parental distrust of public schools, and an immigrant cultural emphasis on academic and professional success. Both Kenway and his brother graduated at 15 years old and enrolled at MIT. Undergraduate life at MIT was a shock in many ways: cool kids were smarter than expected, smart kids were cooler than expected, and students like him and his brother were a dime a dozen. Kenway always imagined being a mathematician or physicist, but freshman physics quickly disabused him of that notion. Saved by freshman pass/fail, he settled on a course of biology and pre-med (to satisfy his medicine-minded mom) and chemical engineering (for his civil engineer dad), but was drawn to scientific research, working his way through research positions in x-ray crystallography (tedious) to cell biology (informative) to cell cycle proteins and oncogenetics (productive). These research experiences - along with a continuing indecisiveness about medicine versus science - led him to applying to MD-PhD programs, where he turned down MSTP funding at other schools to attend Harvard Medical School as an unofficial, unfunded MD-PhD student. Unprepared for the totality of med school, Kenway survived his first two years of classes and returned to MIT for his PhD, switching from molecular biology to systems level neuroscience and the then-nascent technology of multi-electrode recording in awake behaving rodents. Grad school was an awakening of sorts, where he discovered the joys of a variety of pursuits both academic (neural coding, computation, neural networks) and non-academic (travel, motorcycles, rock climbing). Spurred on by the prescient words of a postdoc (“You’ll graduate six months to the day you realize you are DONE with grad school”), he graduated and returned to med school, where he survived clinical rotations largely on people skills hard-earned through lab interactions rather than distant medical knowledge. To his surprise, he gravitated away from his presumed medical disciplines (psychiatry, neurology, neuroradiology) and towards surgical fields like neurosurgery - the urgency and immediate results of operations was a welcome contrast to the drawn out process of scientific research and grad school. This set up an agonizing choice at the end of medical school between neurosurgical residency and postdocs, with academic research winning in the end due to lifestyle, intellectual freedom, and a deep-seated interest in neuroscience. Kenway arrived at NYU in 2004 for a postdoctoral fellowship with Paul Glimcher, driven by a desire to examine neural circuits, cognition, and behavior in the NHP. His most cited work from that time on relative value coding and divisive normalization - which forms the basis of much of the theoretical and behavioral work he currently pursues - was initially viewed by many, including himself, as a simple test-case rotation project for a graduate student. Despite well-cited publications, grant funding, and multiple application cycles, he has yet to secure a tenure-track appointment, leading him to transition into a research faculty position. This kind of position offers both benefits (PI status for grants, mentorship opportunities with graduate students and postdocs, ability to focus on independent lines of work) and costs (lack of job security, ambiguous status in the scientific community, lower pay). Driven by a COVID hiatus, his work has shifted away from experimental neurophysiology to computational and behavioral approaches, which has opened up collaboration opportunities with scientists both within and outside of NYU. He still holds out hope for a transition to a more permanent position, focused on computational approaches to cognition and behavior, but in the meantime enjoys the time that academic research has afforded him with his young family (twins!) in the Northern Westchester suburbs.","frontmatter":{"slug":"/stories/kenwaylouie","date":"2023-10-03","title":"Kenway Louie","tags":["story","event","nyu"],"video":"YLzW5IUAB1s?si=0MgkGxbqo9sU-b7a"}}]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/","query":{},"buildId":"5blsjRdkAiQyOC6sXUFIF","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
