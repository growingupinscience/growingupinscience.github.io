Mentees have an important role in steering this relationship by identifying and making explicit their own needs. Our mentors are not mind readers, and asking for what we need is sometimes all that stands between us and our goal. In this session, we will discuss the concept of \"mentoring up\" (borrowed from \"managing up\" in industry), work through practicalities of where we should each be mentoring up, and answer questions that arise.
